Question: does this index have a index template base on the index settings

Based on the index settings you provided, **this index does not appear to be using an index template.** Here's why:

---

### üîç Key Indicators in Your Settings:

#### 1. **Index Name**

```json
"provided_name": "index-without-template-ilm-rollover"
```

The name itself suggests this index was created manually or without using an index template. Often, templates include automatic index naming patterns (e.g., `logs-*-000001`).

---

#### 2. **ILM (Index Lifecycle Management) Settings**

```json
"lifecycle": {
  "prefer_ilm": "true",
  "rollover_alias": "",
  "origination_date": "-1",
  "name": ""
}
```

* `rollover_alias` is empty ‚Üí no ILM alias attached.
* `name` is also empty ‚Üí no lifecycle policy was assigned via a template.
* Even though `"prefer_ilm": "true"` is present, it doesn‚Äôt mean ILM is active.

So, this is **not managed by ILM** ‚Äî one of the most common features index templates apply.

---

#### 3. **No Custom Mappings or Settings from a Template**

There‚Äôs no sign of:

* A template-defined mapping.
* A template-defined `index.lifecycle.name`.
* Any explicit reference to a component template.

---

### ‚úÖ Conclusion

üìå **No, this index is not using an index template.**
It appears to have been created manually or by a non-templated ingest pipeline, possibly from Logstash or direct indexing via API.

---

If you want to **check from Elasticsearch directly**, run:

```bash
GET _index_template
```

Or check for matching templates:

```bash
GET _index_template?name=*
```

To see if any templates might match the index pattern (`index-without-template-ilm-rollover`).

Let me know if you want help creating a template for this index!
